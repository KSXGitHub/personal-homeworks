# Khai's Web Homework
A bunch of small websites

## Requirements

* Node.js â‰¥ 6.0.0, and npm

* UNIX Shell: BASH

## Building

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm install --only=dev
```

### Build stuffs

```bash
npm test
```

### Caution

This repo contains some symlinks to file
which aren't supported in NTFS file system (i.e. Windows, or at least Git for Windows for some reason).
It is highly recommended to build stuffs (`npm test`) in an UNIX-like file system (i.e. Use Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, etc).
Just in case you love Windows so much, Windows 10 has something called [WSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide).
